Ah Counter Helper for Toastmasters Meetings.

At toastmasters people play different roles. One of those roles is of the Ah-Counter.
An Ah-Counter is responsible for listening to a speaker while paying attention of the 
"fillers", "repeats" and "crutch words" that the speaker uses during the speech.

There is a counter for
- and
- umm
- ah
- repeats
- other crutch words

The purpose of this application is to allow for an interface that allows the user to temporarily(for the scope of one session) record these for every speaker.
